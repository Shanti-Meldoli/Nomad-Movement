                        <h3 class="faqs__h3">What can I expect from online coaching?</h3>
                        <p class="faqs__p">Our online coaching offers a completely personalized approach, tailored to
                            your unique needs. Once signed up, here’s what your journey will look like:</p>
                        <p class="faqs__p"><b>1. Initial Assessment Call -</b> Your fitness journey begins with a free
                            assessment call. During this call, we'll delve into your current fitness level, discuss any
                            special needs or requests, and outline your personal fitness goals. This step is crucial for
                            crafting a training plan that's as unique as you are.</p>
                        <p class="faqs__p"><b>2. Customized Training Plan -</b> Based on our initial conversation,
                            you'll receive a
                            tailored training plan on a monthly basis. This plan is designed to fit seamlessly into your
                            lifestyle, taking into account your available time, space, and equipment (or lack thereof).
                        </p>
                        <p class="faqs__p"><b>3. Weekly Check-Ins and Adjustments -</b> Every week, we'll have a
                            consulting session
                            to review your progress, share feedback, and make any necessary adjustments to your training
                            plan. These sessions are key to keeping you motivated and on track towards your goals.</p>
                        <p class="faqs__p"><b>4. Adaptive Training for Life's Changes -</b> We understand life can be
                            unpredictable. Should your circumstances change at any point during your coaching
                            program—whether it’s your schedule, fitness level, or access to equipment—your training plan
                            will be promptly adjusted. Our goal is to ensure that no matter what life throws your way,
                            your fitness journey continues without a hitch.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="faqs__li">
                        <h3 class="faqs__h3">How often should I train?</h3>
                        <p class="faqs__p">The frequency of your training sessions depends on your individual needs and
                            schedule. As a general guideline, We recommend around 3 sessions per week, but we'll work
                            together to create the best schedule for you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="faqs__li">
                        <h3 class="faqs__h3">Do I need any special equipment or a gym membership?</h3>
                        <p class="faqs__p">While having some equipment is helpful for specific goals, we can design
                            effective training programs that can be done with minimal or no equipment, making it easy
                            for you to start moving regardless of your current setup.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="faqs__li">
                        <h3 class="faqs__h3">What types of fitness goals can you help me achieve?</h3>
                        <p class="faqs__p">We can help you to get in shape and feel better with yourself. And if you
                            have any specific goal that you want to achieve in the meanwhile, like losing weight,
                            increasing your strength or learning a specific skill (Muscle Up, Handstand, Pistol
                            Squat...) we can address it together.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="faqs__li">
                        <h3 class="faqs__h3">How long will it take to see results?</h3>
                        <p class="faqs__p">The timeline for results varies depending on the goal and the person, but
                            with consistent effort and good habits, you'll notice progress week by week.</p>
                        <p class="faqs__p">It’s all about building a habit, so stay committed, and you'll achieve your
                            goals.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="faqs__li">
                        <h3 class="faqs__h3">Do I need prior experience?</h3>
                        <p class="faqs__p">Being an online coaching system, having prior experience is helpful but not
                            required. If you are a beginner, we'll start by focusing on your technique and building a
                            solid foundation to progress from there.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="faqs__h3">Is it possible to do in-person training sessions?</h3>
                        <p class="faqs__p">Our training system is primarily online, but if you're near Sitges (south of
                            Barcelona), we can discuss the possibility of in-person sessions. Let's connect and decide
                            what works best for you.
